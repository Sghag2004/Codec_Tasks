Build a sentiment analysis tool to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using the datasets "twitter_training.csv" and "twitter_validation.csv".

Load the `twitter_training.csv` and `twitter_validation.csv` datasets into pandas DataFrames.

Import pandas and load the two CSV files into dataframes as instructed.

The initial inspection revealed that the datasets are missing headers, as the first row seems to be part of the data rather than providing meaningful column names. The columns are also named with values from the first row, which are not descriptive. To address this, I will reload the datasets with appropriate column names, assuming the columns represent 'Tweet_ID', 'Entity', 'Sentiment', and 'Tweet_Content'. This will make the data more understandable and easier to work with in subsequent steps. After reloading, I will display the first few rows again to confirm the new structure and column names.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The training dataset had 686 missing values in the 'Tweet\_Content' column, while the validation dataset had no missing values.
*   Sentiment labels were encoded numerically, where 'Positive' was encoded as 3, 'Irrelevant' as 0, 'Neutral' as 2, and 'Negative' as 1.
*   After splitting the training data, the training set contained 56,011 samples and the validation set contained 18,671 samples.
*   The TF-IDF vectorization resulted in 29,391 unique terms (features) from the training data.
*   A Logistic Regression model was trained for sentiment classification.
*   The trained model achieved an accuracy of 0.7361, a weighted precision of 0.7374, a weighted recall of 0.7361, and a weighted F1-score of 0.7346 on the validation set derived from the training data.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The model's performance metrics suggest it has a moderate ability to classify sentiment. Further hyperparameter tuning of the Logistic Regression model or exploring other classification algorithms could potentially improve performance.
